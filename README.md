# FLaMingoS
Functional Latent datA Models for clusterING heterogeneOus time-Series

FLaMingoS is a toolbox for the simultaneous clustering (or classification) and segmentation of heteregenous functional data (i.e time-series ore more generally longitudinal data), with original and flexible functional latent variable models, fitted by unsupervised algorithms, including EM algorhims.

Our nice FLaMingoS are mainly:

mixRHLP 

mixHMM

mixHMMR 

PWRM

MixReg

unsupMixReg

The models and algorithms are developped and written in Matlab by Faicel Chamroukhi, and translated and designed into R packages by Florian Lecocq, Marius Bartcus and Faicel Chamroukhi.
